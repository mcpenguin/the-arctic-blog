## About

*Joget FB Marketplace* is an application built using the Joget framework, which itself
is built on Java and MySQL, to help vendors sell their products via streaming through Facebook Live. 
It allows vendors to start a stream on Facebook, and customers can order products by commenting on said streams.
It also integrates a payment gateway for customers to pay for the vendors'
products. The app is still in development, so no link is currently available
for now.
