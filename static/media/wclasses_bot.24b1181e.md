## About

WClasses Bot is a Discord bot that, after specifying a Waterloo course (e.g. MATH 135), returns a brief
summary of the course, including its description, the level it is taught at (undergrad/grad), the amount of units it is worth and the prerequisites, anti-requisites and corequisites. 

Whilst this has been done before by other Discord bots, my bot is the first Discord bot (that I know of) that also displays the classes offered for each course (for the specified term), including the respective capacities of the sections, the professor teaching each section and the class locations.

Additionally, the bot is also the first ever online system to successfully integrate Laurier BU courses into its system, making it
compatible with Double Degree plans as well.
