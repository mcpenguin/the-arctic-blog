## About

In this project, I use Python's Beautiful Soup library to automatically fetch Malaysian COVID-19 data from https://kpkesihatan.com/ and https://covid19.place/ and stores the data into a MySQL database, which can then later be used for data analysis.

In the future, I plan to use a website (most likely using React, but I might try to use Django or Flask) to display the data using graphs and maps, and perhaps combine my existing data with other sources of data (e.g. vaccination rates, cluster locations etc) to help visualize the status quo of COVID-19 in Malaysia.
