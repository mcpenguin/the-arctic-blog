                "description": "In this course we will introduce the ‘language’ of statistics, and the importance of precision in how we both ask and answer statistical questions. We will explore various methods of statistical analysis, including how to describe data (both numerically and graphically), how to estimate unknown information (such as the proportion of a population who have a particular disease), and how to set and test hypotheses (such as whether a vaccine is effective). The course will approach topics from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, with real-world examples as well as mathematical derivations. By the end of this course you will be familiar with a wide variety of ideas foundational to an understanding of statistics.",

The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.",
